# Introduction
In this module, you'll create a cross-platform ASP.NET Core Razor Pages web app with .NET and C#.

This module uses the .NET CLI and Visual Studio Code (Windows, Linux, and macOS) to demonstrate ASP.NET Core Razor Pages development. After completing this module, you can apply its concepts using a development environment like Visual Studio (Windows), Visual Studio for Mac (macOS), or Visual Studio Code.

This module uses the .NET 6.0 SDK. Before beginning the module, ensure that you have .NET 6.0 installed by running the following command in your preferred terminal:
```
dotnet --list-sdks
```

# Example Scenario
Suppose you're an employee of a pizza company named Contoso Pizza. Your manager has asked you to develop a pizza inventory management page as a prerequisite for the company's internal admin website. The app should be built in such a way that the view and data model concerns are separated.
